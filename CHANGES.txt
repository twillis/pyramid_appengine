0.7
----------------

bump sdk version to 1.7.2

adding "unzip=true" to the buildout.cfg template to help out with eggs
that are distributed that way

pinning to pyramid version 1.3


0.6.1
-----------------
bump SDK version to 1.6.6

0.6: 06-13-2012
------------------

changed buildout.cfg to ignore site-packages which should fix a lot of
issues with various namespaces packages that pyramid potentially
depends on.



0.5.4.1: 05-05-2012
-------------------

doc corrections



0.5.4
-----------------

upgrading buildout to appengine sdk 1.6.5 and pyramid 1.3

changed application template to not use an ini file because it doesn't
really add any value on appengine, but handling the paste*
dependencies is troublesome for the recipe rod.recipe.appengine under
some circumstances.

This is just the default behavior of course, there's nothing stopping
you from deploying with an ini file if you wish.


0.5.3: 03-27-2012
-----------------

upgrading buildout to appengine sdk 1.6.4, the first SDK which works
with python2.7.

fixes to address github issue #6
